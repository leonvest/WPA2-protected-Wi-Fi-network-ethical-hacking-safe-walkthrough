# 6) Manual service validation

Goal:
- Confirm that a host actually provides a service
- Document evidence in a controlled way

Good evidence includes:
- HTTP status code
- Response headers
- Page title or visible content

We intentionally do not include flag-extraction patterns.

Suggested report wording:
> “The web service responded successfully, and the flag was verified within the page content.”
