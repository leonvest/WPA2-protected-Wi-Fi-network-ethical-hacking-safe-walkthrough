# 1) Scan and identify the Wi-Fi network

Goal:
- Identify the target SSID
- Determine which security protocol is in use (RSN / WPA2)

Key observations to document:
- SSID name
- Presence of RSN information (indicates WPA2)
- Signal strength (useful for troubleshooting)

Report wording example:
> “The scan revealed SSID X using RSN, indicating WPA2 security.”
