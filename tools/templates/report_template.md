# Wi-Fi Lab Report Template

## Objective
- Connect to a WPA2-protected Wi-Fi network
- Verify network connectivity
- Identify and validate an internal service

## Method
- Scan: SSID and RSN identification
- WPA config: creation and file permission hardening
- Connection: wpa_supplicant and handshake verification
- IP: DHCP and link checks
- Service: limited, manual validation

## Results
- SSID:
- Security (RSN/WPA2):
- IP address:
- Link status:
- Service identified:

## Discussion
- Why did the approach work?
- What restrictions existed (sudoers, flags)?
- How could this be defended in a real environment?

## Conclusion
- Key takeaways and lessons learned
